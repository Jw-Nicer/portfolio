I specialize in building automated analytics systems that bridge the gap between data and decision-making.

My approach combines technical expertise in SQL, Python, and modern BI tools with a deep understanding of business objectives. I don't just analyze data—I build systems that continuously deliver insights.

Whether it's automating weekly reports that save 10+ hours, designing real-time dashboards for executive teams, or uncovering patterns in customer behavior, my work focuses on creating tangible business value.
